		<p id="content">Based on the feedbacks from every participant, the project is a very unique experience for them to get their own image in a new way and get hands on a very special self-sculpture.  As I wish to expend this project into a larger scale, I would like to purpose this project to some big events like my graduation ceremony. With an improvement on faster scanning and printing process, the installation would create sculptures for graduate students with their best friends, lovers, and family members. Which I think is a meaningful experience rather than just taking photos.</p>
